Rabbit mode

The car follows a given moving marker.



Cannonball

The car follow a circuit delimited by markers.




Markers

Marker recognition is based on highly reliable markers, from the arUco library.
It gives a precise 3D location of the marker.

Metrics

Visualize in real time values send to servo-motor, data from sensors, distance
to markers or the number of frame per second. Use the power of MQTT and allow
us to keep a trace of what the car do and when.




Archi

Transform a radio-controlled car into an autonomous vehicle. A windows 8 tablet
analyses webcam's image to find markers, and computes them based on a customisable
artificial intelligence. Finally it sends a command to the arduino wich
controls the steering and throttle of the car. And all of this 10 times per
seconds.




Why this project ?

Student in robotic and computer science will be able to use this pedagogic kit
as an experimentation support.

It is also a beautiful demonstration of an application of MQTT.
