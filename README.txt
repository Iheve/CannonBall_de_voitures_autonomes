This is a study project.

You must use Opencv to make it work.

Then open the following Arduino sketch Arduino/arduino_serial.ino
with the Arduino IDE for example. Make the assembly as described 
on the file. Don't forget to supply the servo.

Open the Opencv folder. There is a file called Trackbar.cpp, it will permit you 
to "chose" the color you want to track, by adjusting the HSV values.
Once it's done, adjust the value in the ObjectTracking.cpp file, 
from line 15 to 21.

Launch the sketch on the Arduino, and run the ObjectTracking executable.
